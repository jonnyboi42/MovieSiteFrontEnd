# Movie Site Frontend

## Overview
This repository contains the frontend for the Movie Site application. The frontend is built using **React** and **Vite** for fast development and optimized builds. It also incorporates **Bootstrap** for responsive design and UI components.

## Current Configuration
- **Port**: The frontend is configured to run on **port 5173** by default.

## Prerequisites
Ensure that the backend server is running before starting the frontend. Refer to the [Movie Site Backend README](../movie-site-backend/README.md) for instructions on setting up the backend.

## Getting Started
To run the frontend locally:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/MovieSiteFrontEnd.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd MovieSiteFrontEnd
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

The frontend should now be running on **http://localhost:5173**.

## Upcoming Features
- **Animations**: I am in the process of implementing enhanced animations for better user experience.
- **Additional Features**: More functionalities are planned.
